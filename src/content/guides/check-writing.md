# How to Write a Check: A Rare Skill That Still Comes in Handy

It might feel like something out of a bygone era, but knowing how to write a check is still a useful life skill. Whether you're paying rent, setting up a direct deposit, or mailing a payment to someone who “doesn’t do Venmo,” checks aren’t _completely_ extinct—just rare.

So if you’ve never written one (or need a quick refresher), here’s a complete guide to how checks work, how to fill one out properly, and what all those confusing numbers mean.

----------

## Why Bother Learning to Write a Check?

Even if you mostly pay with apps and cards, here’s when checks still come into play:

-   Paying rent (some landlords still prefer checks)
    
-   Setting up bill pay with smaller businesses
    
-   Sending money by mail
    
-   Paying contractors or services that don’t accept cards
    
-   Making gifts (especially for weddings or graduations)
    
-   Depositing a check to yourself between accounts
    
-   When an institution literally won’t accept anything else
    

So yes, it’s rare—but it still matters.

----------

## First Things First: Where Do You Even Get Checks?

### Option 1: Through Your Bank

Most banks offer checks when you open a checking account, or let you order a checkbook through your online banking dashboard.

-   You can usually choose basic designs or customize them.
    
-   Expect to pay $15–25 for a pack of 100–150 checks (though some banks offer your first set for free).
    

### Option 2: Online Check Printing Services

Sites like Checks Unlimited or Vistaprint let you order custom checks, sometimes at a lower cost than your bank. Just make sure the company is reputable—you're literally handing them your bank details.

### Option 3: Temporary Checks

Need a check _right now_? Some banks can print a few temporary checks for you in-branch, often for a small fee.

## Anatomy of a Check: What Everything Means

Let’s break down the parts of a standard check:

```
+------------------------------------------------------+
| Your Name and Address                               |
| (Pre-printed by the bank or check provider)         |
+------------------------------------------------------+
| Date: _______________                               |
| Pay to the order of: ________________________       |
| $__________________ (numeric amount)                |
| [Amount in words] _____________________________     |
| Memo: ______________________                        |
| Signature: ___________________                      |
+------------------------------------------------------+
| Routing Number | Account Number | Check Number      |
+------------------------------------------------------+

```

And here’s what each part does:

-   **Date**: The date you're writing the check. Usually today's date.
    
-   **Pay to the Order of**: The name of the person or business you're paying.
    
-   **Amount (in numbers)**: The exact amount in numbers—e.g., “$87.45”.
    
-   **Amount (in words)**: The same amount, written out—e.g., “Eighty-seven and 45/100 dollars”.
    
-   **Memo**: Optional. Add a note like “Rent May 2025” or “Invoice #2042”.
    
-   **Signature**: Your signature, authorizing the payment.
    

----------

## What Are the Numbers at the Bottom?

Those funny little numbers at the bottom of a check? They’re actually super important.

-   **Routing Number**: This 9-digit number identifies your bank or credit union. Think of it as your bank’s address.
    
-   **Account Number**: This is _your_ unique account number at that bank.
    
-   **Check Number**: Usually a 3- or 4-digit number that helps you keep track of which check this is (also printed in the upper right corner of the check).
    

Here’s how to identify them:

```
| Routing | Account       | Check # |
| 123456789 | 001234567890 | 1001   |

```

**Pro tip**: These same numbers are what you use to set up direct deposit or link your bank account for payments.

## Step-by-Step: How to Write a Check

Let’s say you’re writing a check for $87.45 to your landlord, Jamie Smith, for May rent. Here’s how you’d fill it out:

1.  **Date**  
    Write today’s date in the top right:  
    `May 28, 2025`
    
2.  **Payee**  
    On the line that says "Pay to the order of", write:  
    `Jamie Smith`
    
3.  **Amount (numeric)**  
    In the small box, write:  
    `$87.45`
    
4.  **Amount (words)**  
    On the line below the payee, write:  
    `Eighty-seven and 45/100 dollars`  
    (If the amount is a whole number, like $120.00, you'd write “One hundred twenty and 00/100 dollars”)
    
5.  **Memo**  
    Optional, but helpful. Write:  
    `Rent - May 2025`
    
6.  **Signature**  
    Sign the bottom right line just like you signed your bank documents.
    

You’re done!

## What Happens After You Write the Check?

Once the check is deposited or cashed:

-   Your bank verifies the check and removes the money from your account.
    
-   If there’s not enough money in your account, the check may “bounce” (get rejected), and you may owe overdraft fees or bounced check fees.
    
-   Always keep track of how many checks you've written and your current balance.
    

----------

## How to Record It (Old-School or Digital)

If you’re using paper checks, it helps to log each one so you don’t forget:

-   Check number
    
-   Date
    
-   Payee
    
-   Amount
    
-   What it was for
    

You can do this in a paper check register (often included with your checkbook), a spreadsheet, or a notes app. It’s basic bookkeeping, and it saves you from surprises.

----------

## Safety Tips for Using Checks

-   Never leave blank spaces—especially in the “Pay to” and amount fields.
    
-   Always write clearly in ink.
    
-   Don’t sign a blank check.
    
-   Shred old or voided checks.
    
-   Keep your checkbook in a safe place (not loose in your car or bag).
    
-   If you lose a check, call your bank and put a stop payment on it.
    

----------

## Alternatives to Writing a Check

If you're wondering, “Can’t I just do this online?”—yes, most of the time! Here are some modern alternatives:

-   **Zelle** (linked to your bank account)
    
-   **Venmo, PayPal, or Cash App** (for person-to-person payments)
    
-   **Online Bill Pay** via your bank (often sends a check _for_ you)
    
-   **Wire transfer or ACH** (for larger or business payments)
    

Still, every once in a while, writing a physical check is the easiest or only option.

----------

## Wrap-Up: Checks Aren’t Dead Yet

You might not use checks every week—or even every year—but when you need one, it pays to know what you’re doing.

Keep a small stash on hand, learn what those bottom-row numbers mean, and follow the simple steps to fill it out cleanly. That way, when you _do_ need to write a check, you can do it with confidence (and maybe even impress someone who thinks you’re a financial wizard).

You're officially check-literate. Add that to your grown-up skills list.
