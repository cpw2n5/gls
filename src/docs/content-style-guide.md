### Dates and Times

- Use the format Month Day, Year (e.g., January 1, 2025)
- Use AM/PM in capitals without periods (e.g., 9:00 AM)
- Specify time zones when relevant (e.g., 9:00 AM EST)

### Abbreviations and Acronyms

- Spell out acronyms on first use with the acronym in parentheses
- Don't use periods in acronyms (e.g., IRA not I.R.A.)
- Use % instead of "percent" in data-heavy content

## Examples

### Good Headline Examples

### Good Paragraph Example

> Creating a budget doesn't have to be complicated. Start by tracking your spending for 30 days to understand where your money goes. Then, categorize your expenses into needs, wants, and savings. Aim to allocate 50% to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings. This simple framework gives you flexibility while ensuring you're saving for the future.

### Bad Paragraph Example (Revised Version Below)

> Budgeting is an essential component of financial management that individuals should implement to ensure fiscal responsibility and monetary allocation optimization. The implementation of a budgetary system facilitates the monitoring of expenditures and income, thus enabling the practitioner to make informed decisions regarding their financial portfolio and future economic stability.

### Revised Version

> Budgeting helps you take control of your money. By tracking what comes in and goes out, you can make smarter decisions about spending and saving. A simple budget can reduce stress and help you reach your financial goals faster.
