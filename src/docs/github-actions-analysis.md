# GitHub Actions Analysis for Linting and Testing

## Current Setup

### Linting Configuration
- The project uses ESLint with recommended rules and specific configurations for different file types:
  - `.astro` files use `astro-eslint-parser` with TypeScript support
  - `.ts` files use `@typescript-eslint/parser` with TypeScript recommended rules
  - `.js` files use standard ESLint with modern JavaScript support
- Package.json includes two linting scripts:
  - `lint`: `eslint src --ext .js,.ts,.astro`
  - `lint:fix`: `eslint src --ext .js,.ts,.astro --fix`
- All necessary ESLint packages are already installed

### Testing Configuration
- No testing framework is currently installed
- No testing scripts are defined in package.json

### Current CI/CD Setup
- There's an existing GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) that:
  - Runs on pushes and pull requests to the main branch
  - Sets up Node.js v18
  - Installs dependencies with `npm ci`
  - Builds the site with `npm run build`
  - Deploys to Cloudflare Pages
- The current workflow doesn't include linting or testing steps

## Recommendations

### Testing Framework Selection
For this Astro.js project with TypeScript, I recommend:

- **Vitest**: A Vite-native testing framework that works well with Astro
  - Advantages: Fast, ESM-compatible, similar API to Jest, works well with TypeScript
  - Required packages: `vitest`, `@testing-library/dom`, `happy-dom` or `jsdom`

- **Playwright** (optional): For end-to-end testing of the rendered pages
  - Advantages: Comprehensive browser testing, works well with static sites
  - Required packages: `@playwright/test`

### Additional Dependencies Needed

For Unit/Component Testing:
```
vitest
@testing-library/dom
@astrojs/test-utils
```

For E2E Testing (optional):
```
@playwright/test
```

### Recommended Testing Scripts
Add to package.json:
```json
"test": "vitest run",
"test:watch": "vitest",
"test:coverage": "vitest run --coverage",
"test:e2e": "playwright test"
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow Implementation

#### Option 1: Enhance Existing Workflow
Add linting and testing steps to the existing `deploy.yml` workflow before the build step:

```yaml
- name: Lint
  run: npm run lint
  working-directory: ./

- name: Run tests
  run: npm run test
  working-directory: ./
```

#### Option 2: Create Separate Workflows
Create dedicated workflows for linting and testing that run independently:

1. **Linting Workflow** (`lint.yml`):
   - Runs on all pull requests and pushes to main
   - Performs only linting checks

2. **Testing Workflow** (`test.yml`):
   - Runs on all pull requests and pushes to main
   - Performs unit and component tests
   - Optionally runs E2E tests

This analysis provides a foundation for implementing robust GitHub Actions workflows for linting and testing in your Astro.js project.
